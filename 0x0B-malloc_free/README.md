Tasks

00
it looks like this first task is essentially to make a 1Dimension array of the given size, and fill each slot with the given char (one char)
We have to malloc the space we're gonna use. when you memory allocate (malloc), it'll return a pointer to where that memory is.

01
same as 00, but after allocating, make it scan through the string provied and shove it into the target memory
