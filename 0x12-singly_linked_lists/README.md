This is our Singly Linked Lists repository.

Linked Lists are structures (nodes) that store both usable data, and the address of the next node in the list.

- The final node will be equal to NULL

# Task 1

Task 0 example main file was using printf("%lu",n); where n was a malloced thing itself to denote the numebr of elements.

- printf man 3 says %l makes the following unsigned/int a long format.

- u makes the following int unsigned

That said, that n directly equals the return of my previous Task 0, and the example calls those "elements," so maybe taht jsut means the numebr of nodes

- I can certianly try that
