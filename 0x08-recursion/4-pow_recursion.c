/**
 * _pow_recursion - multiplies x by itself y times
 *	calls self and givs it x, y-1
 *power is number times itself
 * for example, 5^5 = 5x5x5x5x5
 * @x: number to be multipliedâ™¥
 * @y; number of times to multiply x
 * Return: x times self,y-1
 *	but only if y is 0 or higher
 *Returns -1 ifi nput was negative

 *copied form Task 3,
 *changed it to appropriate variables.
