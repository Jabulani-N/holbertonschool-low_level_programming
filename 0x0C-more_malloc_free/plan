it may be wise to bakcup current state, test another's work. perhaps more than one.
compare the outputs, and see what differences may have caused them

in particular, test them with the negative minimum.

turns out the addresses were not faulty, and in fact my code was already completely functoinal.
I tested this by copying someone else's pproject and checking their memory allocation and seeing it was the same as what I already had.
	- It looks like just haivng more that 10 mem slots turns into getting weirdly named memory locations
