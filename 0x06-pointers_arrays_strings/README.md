this readme will have some notes


in question 1-strncat, we'll copy the previous question except:

we're gonna change the while condition on the srcSize finding loop to include AND the size is =< than the ammount alloted by n
- n will be an integer, but the previous task's quiz tells us the byte-size of chars. we can do in-if-statment math to find the position cap
