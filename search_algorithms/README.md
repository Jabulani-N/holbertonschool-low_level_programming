# Search Algorithms

this is a c project that will use prototypes.

Reference my own previous work in this repository for notes on the structure of c programming

The header file is `search_algos.h`.

Requirements:

* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

* You are not allowed to use global variables

* No more than 5 functions per file

* You are only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library. Any call to another function like `strdup`, `malloc`, â€¦ is forbidden.


## Task0

* checked via `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear`
each check will need to print in this format:

* `Value checked array[2] = [42]`

* * this means it checked index 2 and found `42`
