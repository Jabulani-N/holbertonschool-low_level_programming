#Structures

Structures seem to be wayas to package varibales.

- Held variables can be acessed like array elements

- - via their position: exampleStructure{first will become this, second will become this}

- - Via direct call: exampleStructure.variableName will behave as the variable variableName that is held within structure exampleStructure

- - via combining the two: exampleStructure{.variableName2 = x, .variableName1 = y} will change the reespective variables within, regardless of their position in the structure.


#Betty

Structures are documented as follows:

................

@examplevar1: description of relevant varaible examplevar1

Description: optional really long description
................

for th estructure and it's varaibles (don't have to put them adjacent, probably)
