changes under consideration

- utilize "read -r" to read multi-word inputs and send them to the commit message (the words after the '-m' part)

- -initialize a variable to hold that read result.initialize it empty

- - -  While it is empty,ask user to enter a message, then make that var equal read -r.

- - - - this forces the user to enter a message, and avoid the scary hassle screen that come sup when you try to send no commit message
