This is our More  Singly Linked Lists repository.

Linked Lists are structures (nodes) that store both usable data, and the address of the next node in the list.

- The final node will be equal to NULL, meaning NULL is a valid node.

- - we'll still count that NULL as not being 1 node, so if that's alone in the list, the list has size 0
