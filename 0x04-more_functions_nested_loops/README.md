instead of printing text normally, you need to send the characters to the _putchar function and have it do the printing instead.

This README is copied from teh 0x02 README.md


square you'll jsut do a 'spam the character n times' loop inside a 'print newline n times' loop. before the 'newline' part.


fizzbuzz:
you'll do a 'print i' loop that iterates n times, but install an if statment that checks if it is multiple of 3 (fizz) - if so, also check 5 (buzz)if yes
then
elif 5 (buzz)
else
print the actual number


triangles is what you accidentally made in task 7 when you make the spaces bit count backwards in stead of forwards.
have it jsut use i instead of n-i, and youll get the general shape by default.
its up to you to get the characters that go into the the trinangle, though.
